## Better substitution number than 1
You have substituted 'X' and 'Y' with the number 1, is it the best substitution or another substitution could make your life easier?

**Answer**
No, I think a number which could also work in my solution would be 0. With a 0 I just would have to change the line 81 in Alien.py, but every other number would probably just make it worse.
